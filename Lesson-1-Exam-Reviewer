SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY
This reviewer covers important historical contributions in science, philosophy, and technology, ensuring you are well-prepared for your exam.

1. NICOLAUS COPERNICUS (1473â€“1543)
ðŸ”¹ Contribution to the Philosophy of Science
Heliocentric Model â†’ The Sun is at the center of the universe, not Earth.

His ideas challenged the Ptolemaic geocentric model (Earth-centered universe).

Published De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres) in 1543, marking the Scientific Revolution.

His model explained:

Planets orbit the Sun in a logical sequence.

Two types of planetary motion:

Inner planets (Mercury & Venus) orbit closer to the Sun.

Outer planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) orbit farther from the Sun.

ðŸ”¹ Controversy with the Church
The Catholic Church banned his model as it opposed religious beliefs.

His ideas were ignored in Rome for the rest of the 16th century.

ðŸ“– THINK QUESTIONS:
What is Copernicus' contribution to science?

Is a thought experiment (thinking through ideas without testing them physically) still useful in modern science?

Should religion influence scientific discoveries?

2. CHARLES DARWIN (1809â€“1882)
ðŸ”¹ Contribution to Modern Science
Developed Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.

Published The Origin of Species (1859), presenting overwhelming evidence that species evolve over time.

Proposed that all species, including humans, evolved through adaptation and survival.

ðŸ”¹ Controversy
His theory challenged religious beliefs that humans were created by God.

The Descent of Man â†’ Argued that humans evolved just like other animals, sparking religious debates.

ðŸ”¹ Application in Modern Fields
Field	Influence of Darwinâ€™s Theory
Economy	Concept of "survival of the fittest" in business and competition.
Agriculture	Used in genetic engineering and selective breeding to improve crops.
Political Science	Inspired Social Darwinism (controversial idea that some societies are superior).
Religion	Some religious groups reject evolution, while others integrate it with faith.
ðŸ“– THINK QUESTIONS:
What was Darwinâ€™s impact on science?

How does evolutionary theory affect modern fields like economy, politics, and religion?

3. SIGMUND FREUD (1856â€“1939)
ðŸ”¹ Contribution to Psychology & Science
Developed Psychoanalysis â†’ A method to study human thoughts and behavior.

Proposed the Unconscious Mind â†’ Human actions are influenced by hidden thoughts and desires.

Focused on human sexuality and the "evil nature" of man, which was controversial.

ðŸ”¹ Controversies in Freudâ€™s Ideas
His theories on sexuality, dreams, and childhood experiences were seen as unorthodox.

Many of his ideas were not scientifically proven, but still influence modern psychology.

ðŸ“– THINK QUESTIONS:
What are some controversial aspects of Freudâ€™s theories?

If Freud were alive today, what changes would he make to his theories?

4. SCIENCE IN MESOAMERICA (MAYANS, INCAS, AZTECS)
ðŸ”¹ Mayan Civilization (2000 BCEâ€“1500 CE)
Advanced in Astronomy â†’ Used temples for astronomical observations.

Created complex calendar systems â†’ Used for planting and religious rituals.

Innovations in Agriculture & Architecture:

Built hydraulic systems for water supply.

Developed rubber products centuries before Goodyearâ€™s patent in 1844.

Created a written language (Mayan hieroglyphics).

ðŸ”¹ Inca Civilization (1400sâ€“1500s CE)
Developed Engineering & Irrigation Systems:

Built roads paved with stones.

Created water storage systems for farming.

Mathematical Innovations:

Used quipu (knotted ropes) to record data.

Developed a calendar system for planting and religious events.

ðŸ”¹ Aztec Civilization (1200sâ€“1500s CE)
Mandatory Education â†’ Required all children to receive formal education.

Engineering Feats:

Built floating gardens (chinampas) for farming.

Created advanced medicine and herbal treatments.

ðŸ“– THINK QUESTIONS:
What were the scientific contributions of the Mayans, Incas, and Aztecs?

How did early Mesoamerican civilizations use science and technology to improve society?
