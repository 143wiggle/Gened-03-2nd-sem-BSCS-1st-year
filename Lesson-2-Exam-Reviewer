INDIGENOUS SCIENCE AND ITS ROLE IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY IN THE PHILIPPINES
This reviewer covers key concepts on indigenous science, its role in scientific development, and its impact on Filipino society.

1. Indigenous Science: Definition & Importance
Indigenous Science refers to traditional knowledge systems developed by local communities over generations.

It is based on observations of nature, experience, and cultural beliefs.

Recognized by UNESCO (1999) as a valuable contribution to modern science and technology.

ðŸ”¹ Importance of Indigenous Science
Helps communities understand nature and adapt to their environment.

Forms the foundation of early scientific discoveries.

Covers many fields:

Agriculture â†’ Crop planting techniques, soil conservation.

Health & Medicine â†’ Use of herbal plants and healing rituals.

Astronomy â†’ Observing celestial bodies to predict weather & seasons.

2. Role of Indigenous Science in the Philippines
Even before Spanish colonization, Filipinos had advanced indigenous knowledge.

They developed:

Tools & structures for farming, hunting, and construction.

Medicinal plant knowledge for treating diseases.

Weather prediction based on star movements.

ðŸ”¹ How Indigenous Science Shaped Science & Technology
Field	Indigenous Knowledge Contribution
Agriculture	Farming techniques, rice terraces, irrigation.
Medicine	Herbal healing, hilot (traditional massage therapy).
Astronomy	Using stars to guide sea navigation.
Engineering	Bamboo houses, fishing traps, boat-making.
3. The Relationship Between Science, Society & Culture
Science and technology are influenced by society & culture.

Examples:

Indigenous knowledge influences modern farming & herbal medicine.

Cultural beliefs affect how people accept scientific advancements.

Traditional practices inspire new technologies (e.g., sustainable farming).

ðŸ”¹ The Cycle of Science & Society
Society creates knowledge through observation & experience.

This knowledge evolves into scientific principles.

Modern science refines & applies indigenous knowledge.
